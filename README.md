Even though birds play an important role of pollination and pest control, they pose a threat that ravages crops in different stages and is quite devastating to the agricultural economy. The conventional practices of using the stationary and existing images of scarecrows are not helpful since birds learn to overcome them. To deal with this problem, we present a novel, solar-based technologically advanced system of an intelligent scarecrow that adapts to the birds’ activities. It is also fitted with an acoustic configuration that allows it to record bird or animal activity based on sound in the surroundings. In their innovation, a DC motor triggers once the sound level rises to alert the presence of people; this makes the scarecrow’s arms move like a human does. Furthermore, a loud-speaker blows sounds to scare away birds/ animals that may be interested in the crops. Indeed, this approach is efficient and ensures the protection of all agricultural fields as the fence is self-powered using solar electricity which does not need a connection to the main power supply. Using both motion and sound, this scarecrow should be able to deter birds from devouring the crops, all the while being solar powered to help the agricultural society.
